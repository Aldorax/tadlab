            Digital platforms have become central to contemporary political engagement across Africa, particularly among
            young people in urban contexts. From social media–driven protest mobilization to new forms of civic
            participation and political expression, digital technologies are reshaping how political action is
            organized, communicated, and sustained.
          </p>
          <p>
            This research project examines the role of digital platforms in shaping youth political mobilization across
            selected African cities. Rather than focusing on single-country case studies, the project adopts a
            comparative approach to identify recurring patterns, mechanisms, and outcomes across different political and
            social contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The study aims to generate evidence that supports informed policy responses to digitally mediated political
            participation, with particular attention to governance, civic space, and democratic accountability.

        <div className="space-y-4 text-[#767676] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Across Africa, urban youth populations are growing rapidly, while access to digital technologies and social
            media platforms continues to expand. These developments intersect with long-standing political grievances,
            economic precarity, and demands for accountability.
          </p>
          <p>
            While digital activism is often portrayed as either transformative or superficial, existing research
            frequently fails to account for the specific political, institutional, and social contexts in which digital
            mobilization occurs. Moreover, policy responses to digitally mediated political participation are often
            reactive and fragmented.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project responds to these gaps by grounding analysis in real-world contexts and examining digital
            mobilization as part of broader political ecosystems rather than as an isolated phenomenon.

        <div className="space-y-4 text-[#767676] leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            In line with the lab's commitment to participatory research, youth participants and civic actors are
            actively involved in shaping research questions, interpreting findings, and identifying policy-relevant
            implications.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach ensures that knowledge production is collaborative and that research outcomes reflect the
            perspectives of those most directly engaged in political mobilization.
